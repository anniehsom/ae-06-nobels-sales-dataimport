* Read in the Excel file called `sales.xlsx` from the `data-raw/` folder 
such that it looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-1.png")
```

```{r sales, eval=FALSE}
sales <- read_excel("data-raw/sales.xlsx", skip = 3, col_names = c("id", "n"))
sales
```

* **Stretch goal:** Manipulate the sales data such such that it looks like the 
following.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-2.png")
```

```{r stretch}
sales %>%
  mutate(
    is_brand_name = str_detect(id, "Brand"),
    brand = if_else(is_brand_name, id, NULL)) %>%
  fill(brand) %>%
  filter(!is_brand_name) %>%
  select(brand, id, n)
```
